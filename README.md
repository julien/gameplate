generator-phaser
=================

A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator to create HTML5 games with [phaser](http://phaser.io/). This generator allows for the creation of Phaser source code made with best practices. The main generator (`yo phaser`) outputs a basic game's structure or a full Phaser game (if you so choose in an ES6 project). You can also generate new prefabs (`yo phaser:prefab`) or states (`yo phaser:state`) to add to your project.

You can view your game in the browser by running `npm start` from your home directory and the web page will refresh as you save your files. It is recommended to view your game in Chrome, as it usually supports more features than FF or IE  (i.e. audio).

When you are ready to publish, build your game with `npm run build` and view the output in the `build/` folder. The build process minifies and compresses individual files into one file for faster network downloading, and if you're developing an ES6 game, it automatically outputs ES5 compatible code using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

+ Install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org)

+ Install the required npm modules by issuing these commands:

  `npm install -g yo generator-phaser`

+ Create a new directory for your game:
  + Unix/OSX : `mkdir ~/Desktop/mygame && cd $_`
  + Windows  : `mkdir %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\mygame && cd %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\mygame`

+ Invoke the generator:

  `yo phaser`

+ Invoke the state generator (Note: this updates & overwrites `main.js`):

  `yo phaser:state`

+ Invoke the prefab generator:

  `yo phaser:prefab`
  
+ Invoke the shader generator:

  `yo phaser:shader`

+ Run a local development server (livereload enabled) with this command:

  `npm start`

+ Package your game (i.e. minify css, html and js) with:

  `npm run build`

**Notes**

The game's `main.js` file will be updated with new states when you run the state generator. It adds in .js files found in the 'src/states/' directory.
